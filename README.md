# classwork-AcademyPGH
These are projects and apps that were built while enrolled at Academy PGH.

This project was made with C# for the app functionality and uses sql to create and access a database to house the "plant" information.
The database is called with the connection string at the beginning of code and is seen throughout the app being used to call different 
portions of the database in reference to the users input.
