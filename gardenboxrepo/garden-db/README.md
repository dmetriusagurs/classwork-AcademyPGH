# Garden Boxes

Create an application that asks the user for the size of their raised beds. Tell them what the perimeter and area of their garden is.

Then, using a database (with data from http://www.mysquarefootgarden.net/plant-spacing/), allow the user to select which crop they wish to plant. Show the user how many plants of that crop they can fit into their space.
